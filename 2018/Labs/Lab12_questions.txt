1 Create a one-time background job to find all the PowerShell scripts on the C:
drive. Any task that might take a long time to complete is a great candidate for a
job.

2 You realize it would be helpful to identify all PowerShell scripts on some of your
servers. How would you run the same command from task 1 on a group of
remote computers?

3 Create a background job that will get the latest 25 errors from the system event
log on your computer and export them to a CliXML file. You want this job to
run every day, Monday through Friday, at 6 a.m., in order for it to be ready for
you to look at when you come in to work.

4 What cmdlet would you use to get the results of a job, and how would you save
the results in the job queue?
