The following command is for you to add to a script. You should first identify any elements
that should be parameterized, such as the computer name. Your final script
should define the parameter, and you should create comment-based help within the
script. Run your script to test it, and use the Help command to make sure your
comment-based help works properly. Don’t forget to read the help files referenced
within this chapter for more information.
Here’s the command:

Get-WmiObject Win32_LogicalDisk -comp $env:computername -filter "drivetype=3" | Where { ($_.FreeSpace / $_.Size) -lt .1 } | Select -Property DeviceID,FreeSpace,Size

Here’s a hint: At least two pieces of information need to be parameterized. This command
is intended to list all drives that have less than a given amount of free disk space.
Obviously, you won’t always want to target localhost (we’re using the PowerShell equivalent
of %computername% in our example), and you might not want 10% (that is, .1) to
be your free-space threshold. You could also choose to parameterize the drive type
(which is 3, here), but for this lab leave that hardcoded with the value 3.
